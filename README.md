# Blockchain Homework #

## Proof of Authority Development Chain ##

In this assignment, I have set up a private testnet to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.  I have configured a new environment, ethereum, a network which I called "cliquernet" and used the following tools:

- Puppeth, to generate the genesis block.
- Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.
- The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm.
- Metamask, instead of MyCrypto wallet, for ease of use.

I used the Metamask GUI wallet instead of MyCrypto for this homework because it was more convenient to use.  I have found that connecting to the networks was not very stable using MyCrypto as compared to using Metamask. This is how the initial balance looks like.

Below is how setting up the custom RPC node looks like.  I have used the network name "cliquernet" and network/chain ID 315, which I have previously set up.

As soon as that was set up, sending a transaction was a breeze.  Here I sent 1898 ETH to the same address.
